Acknowledgements
====================

We stand on the shoulder of giants.

We would like to thank:

* The python ecosystem: python and a large list of libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, among many others).
* The Jupyter Notebooks: the game changer in using python interactive and documentable.
* Colab and Mybinder: for making easy to share and run jupyter notebooks. 
* Read the docs: for making very easy to make and share good documentation.
