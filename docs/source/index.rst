======================================================

**GenericSimulationLibrary** is a package encapsulates a methodology and tools for reproducible simulations. 
The main idea is to use python and/or jupyter notebooks to provide a lightweight and for-dummies easy 
"Simulation as a Service". 
The framework puts emphasis on simplicity: for the client to install and use, 
for the programmer to distribute and update, and for everyone to store and reproduce results. 
The framework can be personalized and extended for a specific simulation need.
