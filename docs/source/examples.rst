Examples
=============

Example in Google colab
************************
Here is an executable example using `Google Colab <TO_BE_UPDATED>`_. 
Requires a google account (but it's worth it :).

Example in mybinder
*********************

Here is an executable example using `MyBinder <TO_BE_UPDATED>`_.
Does not requires any account, but it will not store results.

Code example
*********************
To run it, you need to install the library. 

To run and save a simulation:

.. code-block:: python

    TO_BE_UPDATED

    
To load a simulation and plot the results:

.. code-block:: python

    TO_BE_UPDATED

As you can see, all you need is to define the inputs and plot options, and run the simulation. 
Libraries and outputs are silently handled. 
Saving, plotting or exporting the results is trivially easy for the user.
