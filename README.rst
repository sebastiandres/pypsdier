Generic Simulation Library
===========================

``GenericSimulationLibrary`` is a package encapsulates a methodology and tools for reproducible simulations. 
The main idea is to use python and/or jupyter notebooks to provide a lightweight and for-dummies easy 
"Simulation as a Service". 

The framework puts an emphasis on simplicity: 

* For the client to install and use. 

* For the programmer to distribute and update.

* For everyone to store and reproduce results. 

The framework can be personalized and extended for a specific simulation need.
